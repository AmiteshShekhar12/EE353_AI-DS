"""# Q1 : EDA

### Q1(a) :  Which variables are usable, and which are not? Why?
`Almost all the variables seem usable as they are related to the success or failure of the campaign. Since the given dataset is already a highly filtered version of the original dataset, which had around 150 features, removing any of them might affect model performance.` <p>
`That being said, among all the features, 'contact' which is the mode of communication used to contact the customer seems less important. Also, it has pretty low correlation with the target variable (0.25). Hence, we can drop it`

### Q1(b) Are there significant correlations or other relations among variables?
`Only among 'poutcome' and 'pdays' is there a significant correlation of 0.65. Even then it is not very high`

### Q1(c)  Are the classes balanced? Classes are in 'deposit' column
`The deposit column has 53% NO and 47% YES classes. Hence it is pretty balanced`

### Q1(d) Which classes will you use?
`The outcome of the campaign is determined whether the customer invested in a long term deposit or not. This is mentioned in the 'deposit' column. Hence, our target classes would be YES(1) and NO(0) in this context`

# Q2
### Select metrics that you will use, such as accuracy, F1 score, balanced accuracy, AUC etc. and state the reason for the choice
`The metrics to be used to judge model performance are as follows:-`
- **F1 Score**: `It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is used when the class distribution is imbalanced`<br>
- **Balanced Accuracy**: `It averages the recall obtained on each class, thus accounting for imbalance b/w classes`<br>
- **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)**: `It measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes`<br>
- **Log Loss**: `It measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction is a probability value between 0 and 1. It is useful for probabilistic models.`<br>
- **Lift Curve**: `It measures the effectiveness of a predictive model by comparing the results with and without the model. It is useful in marketing to evaluate the performance of targeting models.`

# Q3
### Q3(a) Should you be using continuous variables as they are, or should you normalize them, or take a transform? Why?
`Normalization is necessary when using NN or LR (basically models which use gradient based algos) as it helps with convergence, stablises training and improves accuracy by not giving excess weight to features which have very high values due to their type rather than effect on the target.`<br>
`It is also necessary in SVMs as it relies on euclidean norm (distance) to find the optimal hyperplance. Unnormalized features can really screw-up the balance between the margins and hinge loss.`<br>
`DT doesn't need normalization.`<br>
`Therefore, variables such as duration, pdays and balance should be normalized/standardized`

### Q3(b)  Should you be using all values of discrete variables, or should you try to reduce them by combining some of the values?
`Some values of variables such as job and poutcome can reduced by combining them. Values which have low frequency and are rare can be combined into one. We combined other and failure in 'poutcome'`

### Q3(c) Are some variables very likely to be unreliable, noisy, or otherwise immaterial
`Duration is the duration in seconds of the last call. This may be inaccurate or may contain a lot of noise. Also, duration may not be the best parameter for determining the outcome of the call. Also parameters like day and campaign have negative correlation with the target variable deposit, hence may be immaterial to use`

### Summary of Findings

#### Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization
- **Accuracy**: 0.825
- **F1 Score**: 0.8249

#### Random Forest with Grid Search
- **Best Parameters**: `max_depth=20`, `n_estimators=100`
- **Accuracy**: 0.89
- **F1 Score**: 0.8899

#### Conclusion
The Random Forest model, after performing a grid search to optimize the parameters, performed better than the Logistic Regression model with L2 regularization in terms of both accuracy and F1 score. This indicates that the Random Forest model is better suited for this particular classification task.
